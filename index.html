    <h1>Aside 2</h1>
    <p>For the past century movies have played a significant role within our lives. Whether you’re looking for some easy entertainment to pass the time, see the next ‘biggest film of the year’ or taking your partner on a date. People often imply that a movies whole purpose is to just entertain, but is that entirely true?

        Movies allow us to explore our minds -- to experience and feel things we wouldn’t normally feel within the real world, to escape reality. It’s not every day you’re going to be caught up in a car chase down a military runway (Fast & Furious 6), getting hunted in the woods by a psychopath wielding a machete (Friday 13th), or be enlightened by romance (When Harry met Sally).
        
        Think about that time when you tried to decide what movie you were going to stream.Most directors will tell you that their job is not to entertain others, but to tell a story.  Let's talk about David Fincher, someone I really admire. One of his traits to impact a viewer's feeling is the use of camera angles. The Social Network follows this within the opening scene of the film, we’re shown Mark Zuckerberg and Erica Albright positioned in a narrow field of view to show us their relationship with one another. ￼As the scene moves forward Erica ends the relationship with Mark, then the shot becomes wider justifying the distance between the two characters. The final shot of the scene we see Mark sat by himself, the camera still holding the wide shot. please enjoy a movie outside of college.</p>
